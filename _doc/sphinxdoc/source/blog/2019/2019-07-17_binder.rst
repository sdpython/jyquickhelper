    I'm not an expect in javascript and I usually do not look
    why my script does not work for a very long time
    if the first try is not successfull. I found
    :class:`RenderJsDot <jyquickhelper.jspy.render_nb_js_dot.RenderJsDot>`
    quite useful to display :epkg:`graphviz` graph in a notebook
    but for some reason, on Binder, the option ``local=True``
    must be used to make it work.
    You can check what works and what does not on
    `binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sdpython/jyquickhelper/master?filepath=_doc%2Fnotebooks>`_.
