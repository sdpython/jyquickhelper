    :title: Custom javascript does not in jupyter lab

    I was surprised to see that the same code is
    working with a notebook server and not in Jupyter Lab.
    Here is the reason :
    `Jupyter Lab extension to support JavaScript output which are disabled in JupyterLab <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/3748>`_,
    `how to restore script tags in trusted HTML output <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/3118>`_.
    I did not find any easy to enable javascript back.
    A couple of direction:
    `javascriptRendererExtension.ts <https://github.com/twosigma/beakerx/blob/master/js/lab/src/javascriptRendererExtension.ts>`_,
    `jupyter-renderers <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-renderers>`_,
    `vdom <https://github.com/nteract/vdom/blob/master/README.md>`_.
    Maybe, it will get easier.
